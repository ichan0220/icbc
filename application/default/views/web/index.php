                                <p>Om Swastiastu,</p>
                                <p>Dear ICBC customer and travellers all around the world,</p>
                                <p></p>
                                <p>On behalf of the people of the Republic of Indonesia, I would like to express our highest appreciation to ICBC Indonesia in recognising Bali as one of the most favourite international holiday destination through this guide book.</p>
                                <p>Indonesia is the largest archipelagic country in the world and considered as one of the country that has the most diverse ecosystem and abundant of unique cultures. Lapped by the warm waters of the Indian Ocean, Bali is one of the 17,500 island in the Indonesian archipelago. It is the most popular tourist destination in Indonesia. Well-known as the Land of the Gods, this amazing tropical paradise has so much to offer to its visitor. Bali blends spectacular mountain scenery, beautiful beaches, vibrant culture with warm and friendly people, this island is truly a heavenly paradise on earth.</p>
                                <p>Baliâ€™s reputation as a tourist destination is already established in the minds of so many people around the world. It is known as a beautiful island with mountains, temples, palaces, and visits of terraced rice fields. It is known as a place where traditions of art and culture predominate, where the village way of life based on their strong religious beliefs is still in place. But, it is also a place where modern sports such as diving, sailing, rafting and above all surfing have taken hold and are enjoyed by thousands of visitors every year. It is a place where the ultimate luxuries of life, fine dining and spas have reached the peak of perfection.</p>
                                <p>This book will not only bring you a glimpse of Bali but also guide you to explore and experience the best of Bali, therefore, I would like to express our sincere gratitude for ICBC Indonesia for composing such a comprehensive guide of Bali both in english and mandarin.</p>
                                <p></p>
                                <p>Finally, on behalf of the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy, I would like to welcome you all to Bali and enjoy your trip in Wonderful Indonesia.</p>
                                <p></p>
                                <p>Om Shanti Shanti Shanti Om</p>
                                <p></p>
                                <p></p>
                                <p>Warmest regards,</p>
